## DioGIS
Simple webGIS API built using ArcGIS JavaScript.

Thhis is a basic example of how to set up a local developing and testing environment for bulding a webGIS API. 
Note that it will NOT work for you, since none of the spatial (geojson) files can be shared.

## 1) Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download!

## 2) Open any terminal, move to your working directory where all html and js files are stored, for example: *cd D:\DEV*.

## Run your node (fileserver) file: *node dummy_fileserver.js*.

##  If you see the following line appear in the terminal: *Server running with CORS at http://localhost:8080*, you have successfully created a local webserver!

## 3) Go to any browser and run any html files: *http://localhost:8080/dummy_MAIN.html*.

##  The webGIS API appears only if the geojson files exist and their urls are set correctly (change the urls)!
